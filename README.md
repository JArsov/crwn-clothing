# crwn-clothing

e-shop application built with React & Node.js.

## Installing packages
After cloning the repository, you need to install the packages required. This can be done by running either 'yarn' or 'npm install'
in the project's root directory.

## Running the application
The application can be started by running 'yarn dev' or 'npm run dev' accordingly. This command starts both the front-end
and back-end applications. If you want to start the client app only, then 'yarn client' or 'npm run client' should be used. In the same
way, if you want to run the server only, 'yarn server' or 'npm run server' should be used.

## Testing
React-testing-library is used for testing the client application. In order to run the unit tests for the client app,
run 'yarn test-client' or 'npm run test-client' in the projects root directory.

### *Note
All other scripts can be found in either root's package.json or client's package.json file.
